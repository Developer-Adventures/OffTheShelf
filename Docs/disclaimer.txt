This library is a collection of Extension Methods for various types.
It was gathered over a period of many years. As such it is impossible
to give credit to the original authors. While many of the methods were
written by others, many were written by me as well.

If you are an author of one (or more) of the extensions in this library,
please let me know and I will give you credit.

Thank you,
Alec Whittington
